    /// - `pubkey_str`: A string representing the public key of the account for which the
    ///   secondary index key size is being queried.

    /// - `HashMap<RpcAccountIndex, usize>`: A mapping of account indices to their respective key sizes.

    /// This RPC method is used to configure the public TPU address of the node. The TPU address

    ///
    /// ## Parameters
    /// - `public_tpu_addr`: A `SocketAddr` representing the public TPU address to be set.

    /// - `Result<()>`: Returns `Ok(())` if the operation was successful, or an error if
    ///   there was an issue setting the TPU address.

    /// # Notes
    /// - The TPU address is important for a validator node to participate in transaction
    ///   processing and communication with the rest of the Solana network.
    /// - This method is typically used to configure the node's external-facing address, allowing
    ///   it to communicate with clients or other validators.
