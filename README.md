### TL;DR

`surfpool` is to Solana what `anvil` is to Ethereum: a blazing fast ⚡️ in-memory testnet that has the ability to point-fork Solana mainnet instantly.

## Introduction

Surfpool provides a blazing-fast, developer-friendly simulation of Solana Mainnet that runs seamlessly on your local machine. It eliminates the need for high-performance hardware while maintaining an authentic testing environment.

Whether you're developing, debugging, or educating yourself on Solana, Surfpool gives you an instant, self-contained network that dynamically fetches missing Mainnet data as needed—no more manual account setups.

## Features

- Fast & Lightweight – Runs smoothly on any machine without heavy system requirements.

- Dynamic Account Fetching – Automatically retrieves necessary Mainnet accounts during transaction execution.

- Anchor Integration – Detects Anchor projects and deploys programs automatically.

- Educational & Debug-Friendly – Provides clear insights into transaction execution and state changes.

- Easy Installation – Available via Homebrew, Snap, and direct binaries.

## Installation

Install pre-built binaries:

```console
# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install txtx/taps/surfpool

# Linux (Snapstore)
snap install surfpool
```


Install from source:

```console
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/txtx/surfpool.git

# Build
cargo surfpool-install
```

Surfpool can also be used through our public [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/surfpool/surfpool):

```console
docker run surfpool/surfpool --version
```

Verify installation:

```console
surfpool --version
```

## Usage

Start a local Solana network with:

```console
surfpool start
```

If inside an Anchor project, Surfpool will:

- Automatically generate infrastructure as code (similar to Terraform).

- Deploy your Solana programs to the local network.

- Provide a clean, structured environment to iterate safely.

The command:

```console
surfpool start --help
```

Is documenting all the options available.

## Crypto Infrastructure as Code: A New Standard in Web3

Infrastructure as code (IaC) transforms how teams deploy and operate Solana programs:

- Declarative & Reproducible – Clearly defines environments, making deployments consistent.

- Auditable – Security teams can review not just the code of your Solana programs, but the way you will be deploying and operating your protocol.

- Seamless Transition to Mainnet – Test with the exact infrastructure that will go live.

With Surfpool, every developer learns to deploy Solana programs the right way—scalable, secure, and production-ready from day one.

## 🤖 MCP

- Surfpool is getting agentic friendly, thanks to a built-in MCP. We'll be adding more tools over time, the first use case we're covering is "Start a local network with 10 users loaded with SOL, USDC, JUP and TRUMP tokens" (#130 - @BretasArthur1, @lgalabru)
- To get started, make `surfpool` available globally by opening the command palette (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P) and selecting > Cursor Settings > MCP > Add new global MCP server:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "surfpool": {
      "command": "surfpool",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Architecture & How to Contribute

Surfpool is built on the low-level solana-svm API, utilizing the excellent LiteSVM wrapper. This approach provides greater flexibility and significantly faster boot times, ensuring a smooth developer experience.
